Model Name:
Mask Detector CNN

Model Description:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not 
from image data. The model uses 3 convolutional blocks with max pooling for feature extraction, followed 
by dense layers for classification. It performs binary classification (With Mask / Without Mask) with 
96x256 pixel RGB images as input. The model was trained on 10 epochs with adam optimizer and binary 
crossentropy loss function.

Model Parameters:
- Input Shape: (256, 256, 3) - RGB images of 256x256 pixels
- Architecture:
  * Rescaling Layer: Normalizes pixel values to [0, 1]
  * Conv2D Block 1: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel + MaxPooling
  * Conv2D Block 2: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel + MaxPooling
  * Conv2D Block 3: 16 filters, 3x3 kernel + MaxPooling
  * Flatten Layer
  * Dense Layer: 8 neurons with ReLU activation
  * Dropout: 0.3 (30% dropout for regularization)
  * Output Layer: 1 neuron with Sigmoid activation (binary classification)
- Total Trainable Parameters: 130,000+
- Training Configuration:
  * Batch Size: 32
  * Epochs: 10
  * Optimizer: Adam
  * Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
  * Train/Validation Split: 85% / 15%

Model Precision:
Typically achieves 85-95% accuracy on validation data, depending on dataset quality and image diversity.
The confusion matrix shows the true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives 
on the evaluation dataset. (Check accuracy_graph.png and confusion_matrix.png for detailed performance metrics)

Model Inference Code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('./Models/mask_detector.keras')

# Function to predict on a single image
def predict_mask(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    img = cv2.resize(img, (256, 256))
    img = img.astype("float32") / 255.0
    img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)
    
    pred = model.predict(img)[0][0]
    label = "WITHOUT Mask" if pred > 0.5 else "WITH Mask"
    confidence = pred if pred > 0.5 else (1 - pred)
    
    return label, confidence * 100

# Example usage
label, confidence = predict_mask('path/to/image.jpg')
print(f"Prediction: {label} (Confidence: {confidence:.2f}%)")
```
